# Homer Theme

This is my fork of [Homer Theme V2](https://github.com/walkxcode/homer-theme).
I've made very few changes, but added a small script to symlink the assets to homer's assets dir.

This is a theme for [Homer Dashboard](https://github.com/adam-gaia/homer-theme.git).

## Usage

The `apply.sh` script copies the files in `./assets` to `${HOME}/Data/homer/`
